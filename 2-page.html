    <h3>COVID-19</h3>

    <p>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused
      by a new virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with
      symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases,
      difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your
      hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding
      close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
    </p>

    <h5>How it spreads</h5>
    <p>
      Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an
      infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads
      when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus
      on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
